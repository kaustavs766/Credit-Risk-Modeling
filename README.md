# Credit-Risk-Modeling
This  project uses Python and its libraries for implementation of PD (Probability of Default),LGD(Loss Given Default) and EAD(Exposure At Default) models. The models are trained on a dataset, consisting of more than 800,000 consumer loans issued from 2007 to 2014 by Lending Club: a large US peer-to-peer lending company. The Credit Score is also calculated based on demographics (e.g., age, time at residence, time at job, postal code), existing relationship (e.g., time at bank, number of products, payment performance, previous claims), credit bureau (e.g., inquiries, trades, delinquency, public records), real estate data, and so forth. Also the  approval and rejection rates are estimated for each possible threshold level and Credit Score ,based on which cut-off value can be set by banks. Finally the Expected Loss is calculated based on the entire portfolio.
